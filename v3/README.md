# Snake 3

## Installation
First, [download cc3250mt.dll](http://www.dlldownloader.com/cc3250mt-dll) and extract the DLL to the `build` folder, then run `build/Snake3.exe`.

## Known Issues
Anti-virus software will probably prevent execution of Snake2.exe, due to its linkage to cc3250mt.dll. This is a false positive, however.
(Do your own research, if you like. The found, so-called “malicious code” is not even harmful.)
